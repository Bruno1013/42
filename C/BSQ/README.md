# BSQ
The goal of this subject was to find the biggest square you could fill in a file with empty characters and obstacles. The program will then find the square and fill it with a "fill" character.

Due to the lack of a verification for a 1x1 map, the project didn't make it past the maulinette, which made unsure of whether or not it was working as intended.
