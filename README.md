This repository display what I have learned and done throught the course of the piscine at 42 School.
All the files in this repository made it through the maulinette except for the BSQ although having it's algorithm somewhat correct.

### Rush
Rush00 was graded with a full score and a part of the bonus while the other 2 rushes weren't attempted.

### BSQ
The BSQ was, as it is explained it's folder, done somewhat correctly. There was one missing verification which was precisely the first test being made and so, it got graded as 0. Maps starting from sizes such as 400x400 were working, although runtime was bigger than expected.
